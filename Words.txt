The festival began with light, bright light, glowing light across the village. Children carried lanterns, lanterns shining with light and color. 
The music started — music loud, music soft, music everywhere. People began to dance, dance in circles, dance with friends, dance with joy. 
The joy spread — joy in laughter, joy in smiles, joy in hearts. At the center, the bonfire burned with light, light rising, light shining.
The festival continued with music, dance, and endless joy. 
The festival ended, but the light, the music, the dance, and the joy remained.
